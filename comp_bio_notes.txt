class 3: git

anything that starts with a . is hidden

start git: git init

creates new directory called .git
git add filename #stages a file
git add * #stages everything

## this means files are ready for a commit
## commit permanenly saves a snapshot of your work to return to

git commit -m "message" #-m is the message flag

git is monitoring your changes, not copies of everything

HEAD is the most recent commit- also the top commit in the stack

HEAD~1 is the penultimate commit, HEAD~2 is 2 commits ago, etc

easiest way to id recent commits if you need to go back

hash- unique identifiers of each commit, use first 7 characters to call it

git diff- where are you right now wrt most recent commit

git diff HEAD~N filename
- compare specific file with what it was at a commit with the given id

git log is your history

git checkout filename # goes back to last commit, loses all the changes

git checkout HEAD~N filename ## goes back to last version even though you've already committed stuff

git revert #undoes commits
